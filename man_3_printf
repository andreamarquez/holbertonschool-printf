NAME
       _printf - custom implementation of the printf function.

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       _printf  is a custom implementation of the standard C library function
       printf. It produces output according to a format string, interpreting
       format specifiers to print different types of arguments.

       The format string is composed of regular characters (copied as-is to
       the output) and format specifiers (preceded by `%`) that determine how
       subsequent arguments are formatted.

FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       The following format specifiers are supported:

       %c     Prints a single character.

       %s     Prints a null-terminated string. If the string is NULL,
              "(null)" is printed instead.

       %d, %i Prints an integer in decimal notation. Can handle INT MIN

       %%     Prints a literal `%` character.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, _printf returns the total number of characters printed.
       If an error occurs or if the format string is NULL, it returns -1.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
       - The function uses a 1024-byte internal buffer to handle output.
       - Each supported format specifier is associated with a handler
         function defined in the source code (e.g., percent_c, percent_s).
       - Unsupported format specifiers are printed as-is with the leading `%`.

LIMITATIONS
       - Does not handle advanced features like field width, precision, or
         flags (e.g., `+`, `-`, `0`).
       - Limited to the supported specifiers listed above.
       - Buffer size is fixed at 1024 bytes, and outputs exceeding this size
         are flushed incrementally.

USAGE EXAMPLES
       Example 1: Printing a string and an integer.
           _printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", "Alice", 25);

           Output:
           Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.

       Example 2: Printing a literal `%` character.
           _printf("100%% complete.\n");

           Output:
           100% complete.

         structure.
       - printf.c: Contains the _printf function and buffer management logic.
       - handler.c: Defines the handler functions for supported format
         specifiers.
